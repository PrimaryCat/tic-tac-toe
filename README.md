A tic-tac-toe variant

------

# Info

Tic-Tac Blitz! is a singleplayer / local multiplayer browser game made for the tic-tac-toe assignment of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The game is a fast paced strategic variant of tic-tac-toe.

# Rules

The game is played similarly to tic-tac-toe, with some slight modifications to the rules.

The game doesn't end when a player matches three tiles, instead the player who matched them gets 1 point. The first player to get 5 points wins the game.

Additionally, when a match is made, the matching line of tiles is cleared.

Each player gets 3 or 5 seconds to make a move.

Lastly, if the board is full, players can instead claim one of their opponent's tiles.
